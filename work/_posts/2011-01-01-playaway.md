#### **Preloaded and portable products**

Playaway is a pre-loaded and portable audiobook player which is very popular in libraries where patrons can check out individual titles.

As Senior Web Designer, I ran and owned all the web including the creation and management of [each channels' website], the company's intranet and extranet, designed and developed over 100+ promotional HTML emails, automation and creation of all 10,000+ *heroshot* title images, and the creation of many promo microsites.
